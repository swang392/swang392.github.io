## Hello!

I'm Sarah, a sophomore majoring in computer science and English at Yale University. I'm interested in finance, technology, education, and healthcare. Currently, as a software engineer at Facebook University, I'm building all sorts of iOS apps.

Aside from academics, you can find me biking around my hometown of Northern Virginia or (hopefully) traveling around the world. I love to eat and cook -- a vicious but satisfying cycle, dance, and bullet journal. I also have an adorable [little brother](https://imgur.com/a/mTCzuUK) :)

I hope you enjoy these snippets of my life!
