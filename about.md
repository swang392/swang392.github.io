## Hello!

I'm Sarah, a sophomore majoring in computer science and English at Yale University. I'm interested in technology, education, and healthcare. Currently, as a software engineer at Facebook University, I'm building all sorts of iOS apps.

Aside from academics, I love to travel and bike around my hometown of Northern Virginia. I love to eat and cook (a vicious but satisfying cycle), dance, and bullet journal. I also have an adorable [little brother](https://imgur.com/a/mTCzuUK) :)

I hope you enjoy these snippets of my life!
