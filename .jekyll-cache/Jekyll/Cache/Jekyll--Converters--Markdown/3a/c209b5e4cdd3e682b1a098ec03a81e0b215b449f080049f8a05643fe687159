I"n<p>Hello!
I’m Sarah, a sophomore majoring in computer science and English at Yale University. I’m interested in finance, technology, education, and healthcare. Currently, as a software engineer at Facebook University, I’m building all sorts of iOS apps.</p>

<p>Aside from academics, you can find me biking around my hometown of Northern Virginia or (hopefully) traveling around the world. I love to eat and cook – a vicious but satisfying cycle, dance, and bullet journal. I also have an adorable <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mTCzuUK">little brother</a> :)</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy these snippets of my life!</p>
