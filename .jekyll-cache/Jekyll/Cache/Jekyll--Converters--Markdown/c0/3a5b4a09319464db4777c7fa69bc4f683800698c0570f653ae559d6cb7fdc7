I"Å<h2 id="hello">Hello!</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm Sarah, a sophomore majoring in computer science and English at Yale University. I‚Äôm interested in finance, technology, education, and healthcare. Currently, as a software engineer at Facebook University, I‚Äôm building all sorts of iOS apps.</p>

<p>Aside from academics, you can find me biking around my hometown of Northern Virginia or (hopefully) traveling around the world. I love to eat and cook (a vicious but satisfying cycle), dance, and bullet journal. I also have an adorable <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mTCzuUK">little brother</a> :)</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy these snippets of my life!</p>
